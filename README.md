## Note before installation

This extension can be installed via extensions viewlet of VS Code or 'Extensions: install extension' command from the command palette. The author notices that it is developed and tested in **_Logtalk 3.12.0_** and **_VS Code 1.17_** on **_Debian 9.0_** (stretch). It's not yet tested under other environments.

## Features

* [Syntax highlighting](#syntax-highlighting)
* [Snippets](#indentation-snippets-and-auto-completion)
* [Grammar Linter](#grammar-linter)
* [Commands](#commands)

## Feature descriptions and usages

### Syntax highlighting

* Full syntax highlight for all Logtalk built-in control constructs, directives, methods, and predicates
* Full syntax highlight for all ISO Prolog standard built-in control constructs, directives, and predicates
* Built-ins pattern support

### Indentation, snippets and auto-completion

* Indentation after new line
* Built-in directive, method and predicate template auto-completion
* Auto-complete recursive parameters: When '.'(dot) occures as first non-space character, VSC-Logtalk will repeat the nearest above head of clause and automatically change the parameters if possible.

> Note: Relations between entities use choice snippets. 'orel' triggers object relation choices and 'crel' for category. There is only one relation between protocols 'extends', so 'ext' will trigger the snippet.

> The snippets for built-ins all are triggered by natural prefix, i.e. ':- public' triggers ':- public()' directive. You needn't to type all charaters to show up the suggestion list.

> Refter to the table below for other snippets:
